 This a game  is a part of computer graphics lab course in the University of Haifa .

we were very busy cause of holidays and job interviews.

<h2>Week 5-6:</h2>
in this week we added animations , downloaded a character and three movements(jumping,running,standing) we use animator(we had to learn how to use) and connected everything together . (also we synched the animation and it was problematic because it didnt go very smooth) . 16 hours in total.

<h2>Week 8-9:</h2>
<p>those two weeks we worked more than regular(instead of one day we worked 4 days!). we wanted to compensate the time we didnt work during the holidays and the past weeks , the things we have done: </p>
<p>1) we wasted to much hours trying to use mirror instaed of photon for multiplayer,
we thought that the movemnents would be more smooth and clear , but it didnt work so we had to go back to photon , 16 hours in total.</p> 
<p>2) we downloaded a lot of design packages and assests and strating adding design to our world , also we had to add colliders for everything so the players can move on them , this process needed a lot of time ,32 hours in total.</p>
<p> 3) we added a loading and create/enter rooms and designed them. ,16 hours in total.</p>
<p>so 60 hours in total</p>
